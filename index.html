<h1>Jérémie Gerhardt</h1>
<article>I'm a color and computer vision scientist. I did obtain my PhD in signal and image processing in 2007. I did my research in Norway at the now called <a href="http://www.colorlab.no">The Norwegian Colour and Visual Computing Laboratory</a> while being registered in Paris at the now called <a href="http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng">Telecom ParisTech</a>. At the moment I'm writing these words I'm still based in Berlin where I'm living since 2008 after having resided in Norway from 2003, but originally I'm from Paris where I was born in the holy year 1977.</article>
<br>
<article>My research was about multi-spectral color reproduction or how to make perfect copy of a painting. This being possible if you have in your hands a spectral image of your painting, a printer with several inks/colorants and their spectral properties. The rest is mathematic, geometry, optimization, printing technology, color science, color perception. The pdf my thesis is available here [<a href="./data/JeremieGerhardt_Thesis2007.pdf">JeremieGerhardt_Thesis2007.pdf</a>].</article>  
<br>
<article>After my thesis I have been working as an applied scientist in various projects: color correction, immersive display, medical imaging, computer vision, feature points tracking, machine learning-ish, human color perception, VR, image stitching, you name it.</article>
<br>
<article>I like to believe that I'm not only an applied scientist. In that matter I also produce images here and then. Sometimes I do little planet images, more info on that topic here in my Etsy shop <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/JeremieLittlePlanets">jeremieLittlePlanet</a> and some of the tools I developed over the last months <a href="https://github.com/mrbonsoir/little_planet_tools/blob/master/Making%20Little%20Planet/Making%20Little%20Planet.md">little_planet_tools</a>.</article>
<br>
<article>To complete the picture I can also produce moving images for regular to panorama and fully immersive display. That's not over, I also have a beginning of working experience as a colorist.</article>
