The conference tour is still on the road. I left the world of color science and computer vision in California for the world of digital domes and other immersive installations. The [IMERSA Summit][link-imersa] is taking place in this begining of February at the [Denver Museum Nature and Science][link-dmns]. The program is alternating between talks and viewing session in the dome of the museum. There is worse as working condition.

My talk is scheduled for Sunday, no stress yet and enought time to meet this new crowd. A lot of Americans but not only, UK, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Germany, Austrian and even French people are present.

I have seen just the glimpse of dinosaur by a door (this science museum is also showing remains of dinosaurs) while going to the digital dome. Next break in the schedule I will check what seems to be XXXXL bones. I'm not in Denver for nothing.
