It is the third time that I'm able to join the Color Imaging Conference (CIC) after Los Angeles, CA last year and San Antonio, TX in 2010. This time I attend it without article, the one we submitted wasn't exactly finished and did not deserve to be accepted. It is always good to have your paper rejected from a good conference, it only pushes you to improve your work and you end up publishing later a better article. And enough of stating the obvious.

So this time I joined the conference as co-chair on the short course program, or short course session, I never know... Anyway this conference day offers - not for free - a panel of courses given by experts from academia or industry. As co-chair we had, based on last year program, to propose new courses and select submitted courses, they should reflect the latest development in a field and/or give an overview of a given topic (such as multi-spectral imaging or gamut mapping). Interesting and important to me, the courses are also showing connections between research and industry, basic and applied research.

I had the chance to attend three courses: "Normal and Defective Color Vision: from Theory to Simulation" given by Caterina Ripamonti from UCL Institute of Ophtalmology, "Color Grading and Color Management for Motion Pictures" given by Stefan Luka from Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Peter Postma from FilmLight and "What Color is 3D?" given by Matt Cowan from RealD.

The first course was very interesting, because before going to the point of simulating how people with defective color vision see color, state of the art was presented. But more important it shows how color and vision are treated depending of your field of study or depending of your application and which assumptions you are stating to build up your theories and explanations (e.g. which functions are used to approximate how a signal is captured by the eye). We are the border of physiology and computer color science.

The two other courses were related. And the instructors from the color management for motion picture joined the color and 3D lecture after giving their lecture, which ends up with an interesting discussion. A nice aspect of color science in the field of motion picture is the very applied nature of it: how do you capture light, how to process it, how to compose, create with the various available tools and how do you reproduce and display your work.

And I end up having diner with *la crème de la crème* of color scientists based in UK, Australia, Spain and Germany. Fun fact, none of us four are working in our respective country (whatever it means). As usual, the minimum number of language talked per person was 2.4 . Take that narrow minded and obsessed with boundaries people.
