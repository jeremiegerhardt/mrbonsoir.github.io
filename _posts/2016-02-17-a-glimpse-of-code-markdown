Having a lot of time pushes me - I hope - to be organised. So in an attempt to sort my data - mostly pieces of code on Python - in order to make it available when I need it I made a new github repository where I store iPython notebook with a few explanations.

Everything is here [link-randomnotebooks][random notebooks] and maybe it will be of some people interests, or not.
