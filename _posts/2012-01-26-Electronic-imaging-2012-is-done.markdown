The conference is reaching its end. Second time for me to join [Electonic Imaging][link-EI], first time was in San Jos√© four years ago. Different city this time, it took place in Burlingame, but it's still very intense with so many sessions in parallel. I started with a bit of 3D (I did present our paper during the poster session about **stereoscopic surround displays with interference filters**) then I picked through in the program: a bit of color science, a bit of perception, a bit of spectral imaging and of course networking beers with the colleagues from the worldwide color science network.
