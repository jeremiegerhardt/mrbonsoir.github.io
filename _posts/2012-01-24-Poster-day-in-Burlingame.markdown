One day of Electronic Imaging conference. Yesterday a networking diner with people involved in 3D technology and this afternoon the poster session. Two hours standing up, presenting in English and in German our article **Stereoscopic surround displays using interference filters**, the French speaking people passing by must have been scared as none of them dare talking to me.

At the end of the session I can't speak anymore and need desperately something to drink. I reach my room with difficulties, then my bed and soon my sleep... 

A poster asked you less effort on the long term and comes usually with less stress, but when the session starts it's two hours non-stop. No tricky questions during the presentation time, just a kindly crackpot at the end that putting a lot of effort in telling me he knows, he knows more and better than me. I can't really answer his comments as he has the flow of a machine gun. I can't speak anyway.
