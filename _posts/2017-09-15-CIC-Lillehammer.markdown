This year have seen the 25th edition of the Color Imaging Conference ([CIC][CIC-link]) taking place in Lillehammer (Norway) after [San Diego][Last year article CIC], CA last year. This time again I could be part of the committee as a co-chairman for the **Short Course** session. Session where conference attendees or not attendees can register and follow courses (you need to pay for each course you take) on carefully selected topics. Basis of color science courses are of course available but also several advance courses on different topics given by field specialists, allowing students to get a crash course e.g on hdr, color differences and other colorful themes. The instructors are usually coming from academia and/or industry (when their industry allows them to talk) and each course is first submitted, reviewed and/or not accepted.

### Back to Norway

I have been visiting Norway regularly after I left Gjovik and its [colorlab][ntnu-colorlab] (a few km away from Lillehammer) where I did my PhD on multispectral color reproduction. It was something to come back in the lab, seeing old colleagues, that the color lab did grow nicely and was heavily represented at the conference.

### General overview

If it's becoming more and more difficult to be amazed each year, you know a bit more than in your first years but you can still see that each field is evolving slowly, you can witness and appreciate tiny changes, observe the increase of general knowledge.

### Human perception and colour constancy

Keynotes, first and second have been pretty interesting. The first one given by Apple - almost did coincide with the Apple event in California - was impressive and disturbing in the same time. Impressive because of the amount of advanced technology they are able to squeeze into a smartphone. Disturbing by the non research dissemination they are doing. They have a great team of researchers and engineers but all the knowledge stay at work, not sure it will make the people smarter at the end. I'm sure they are not the only company doing that, but they are so big the result of such behavior has an impact.

Second keynote was tilted *Twenty-five Years of Colour Constancy* given by Anya Hurlbert from Newcastle University (UK). Needless to say it was pretty entertaining, for me the typical presentation that make you feel smarter at the end. Colour constancy is a fascinating phenomena which can be understood as white balancing done by the brain. We have not all the same automatic white balance algorithm embedded with us, this resulting
endless discussion on object color (remember the blue-black/yellow-white dress-gate a few month ago?).

### Subjective evaluation, image metrics and database

There are some many metrics it's becoming difficult to follow on that topic. Each of them is trying to mimic how human perception is working, allowing to evaluate image difference, predict how image quality will be perceived when a new algorithm is applied to images.

A solution is to follow a clear experimental workflow which integrate feedback from standard real users. A panel of test person is asked to look at images, original and modified and to compare them. Notion if just noticable difference (JND) is of course very important here. In that case subjective evaluation is often chosen, but here are well they are plenty of existing experimental workflows.

### Human vs bird viewing system

Going to the same conference each year sometimes shows you how alone are  researchers. Most of them are spending their life on one topic and they become hyper specialist. Conference is the occasion for them to leave their laboratory, office and to share their discoveries (in that case other color scientists).

A peculiar article tilted *Super Vision Model: What's Peking Robin Seeing?* by researcher Hiroaki Kotera from Kotera Imaging Laboratory, Chiba, Japan was pretty cool. This research work looked at birds and their visual system: they are tetra-chromate *RGBU* when we are tri-chromate *RGB*. Question being how these animals see colors? *Four sensors and tiny brain Vs us three sensors and bigger brain that allows to post-process the signal and compensate for a lower captor resolution* or how nature optimizes living organism for dedicated tasks within an ecosystem. A parallel can be done with computational photography when the algorithms and post-processing present in smartphone can compensate for their lower quality hardware (to some extend) compare to high-end dslr.

### Workshop session

I could attend only two of the three parallel workshop sessions. interesting on many points. Both workshops *W2: VISUAL PERCEPTION AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN CINEMA: PERSPECTIVES FROM ACADEMIA AND THE INDUSTRY* and *W3: CULTURAL HERITAGE DIGITIZATION: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES* shared cutting age used of technologies. More important they allow to have discussions between professionals from different entities without revealing company secrets.

### La suite

Hope to be part of next year edition in 2018. For now the next destination hasn't been revealed, but according to recent tradition it should return to North America.
