### **Who am I?**
I'm a color and computer vision scientist. I did obtain my PhD in signal and image processing in 2007. I did my research in Norway at the now called [The Norwegian Colour and Visual Computing Laboratory][link-colorlab] while being registered in Paris at the now called [Telecom ParisTech][link-enst]. At the moment I'm writing these words I'm still based in Berlin where I'm living since 2008 after having resided in Norway from 2003, but originally I'm from Paris where I was born in the holy year 1977.

###  **Background**
My research was about multi-spectral color reproduction or how to make perfect copy of a painting. This being possible if you have in your hands a spectral image of your painting, a printer with several inks/colorants and their spectral properties. The rest is mathematic, geometry, optimization, printing technology, halftoning, color science, human color perception... The pdf of my thesis is available on request.

After my thesis I have been working as an applied scientist in one of the Fraunhofer Institutes in Berlin called [FOKUS][link-viscom]. The topics were a mix of color correction, immersive display, medical imaging, computer vision, feature points tracking, machine learning-ish, human color perception, VR, image stitching, you name it. Something I learned in that working environment was to be attentive on finding who can use your technology, foresee new trends and approach clients, customers before they have a problem.

### **What else?**
I like to believe that I'm not only an applied scientist. In that matter I also produce images here and then. Sometimes I do little planet images, you can visit my [Etsy shop][link-etsy] and some of the tools I developed over the last months [little planet tools][link-randomnotebooks] . To complete the picture I can also produce moving images for regular to panorama and fully immersive display. And last but not lost least I have another blog on blogspot called [mrbonsoir Ã  l'internet][link-blogspot].
